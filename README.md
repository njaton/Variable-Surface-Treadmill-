This program was created as a proof of concept for the Variable Surface Treadmill Project funded by a NASA Nebraska Space Grant.This program will use three buttons to operate the motors used in the proof of concept. One button is a value generator, one lifts the cell and one resets the cell. The cell movement was operated with a small motor. A TB6612 was used to control the motors.
