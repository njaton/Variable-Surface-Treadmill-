# Variable-Surface-Treadmill-

Code Written by Nick Jaton

Project Co-authors Travis Vanderheyden, Dr. Kota Takahashi

This program was created as a proof of concept for the Variable Surface Treadmill Project funded by a NASA Nebraska Space Grant.This program will use three buttons to operate the motors used in the proof of concept. One button is a value generator, one lifts the cell and one resets the cell. The cell movement was operated with a small motor. A TB6612 was used to control the motors.

The Power circuit on the PCB has not yet been tested so please use with caution. The PCB and Schematic are both Eagle files.
